Welcome.

This is my blog. I'm a blogger. Was "being a blogger" ever cool?

No. No, it was not.

This first post is always so awkward. I promise you posts. I promise you witty prose. Will I deliver? Will I lose interest immediately? It's a mystery!

I've got ideas for a few weeks' worth of posts. All I have to do now is write them, so the hard part is already over.

*(That was a joke. Writing them is the hard part. See, already with the wit.)*

Oh, right. What will I be writing about here?

Programming, design, typography. Science, maybe. Apple products, probably. I find politics boring and I'm told I should keep my religion off of my blog. I find Twitter to be a better venue for that anyway. Long form text offers too many opportunities for reasonable discourse.
