  <h1>Hi, I'm Josh.</h1>

  <p class="lead">
    I'm a software engineer, occasional designer, gamer, and Jesus enthusiast living in Gainesville, Florida. I'm currently the Director of Development at <a href="http://www.tradepmr.com">TradePMR</a>, where I lead a team of amazing developers and engineers.
  </p>

  <p>
    I've spent most of my career working on the web, and I believe that the web platform offers the best opportunity to positively influence my industry, my peers, and the world. I love the web, and the web has been pretty good to me, too.
  </p>

  <p>
    Enough with the work talk. Here's some stuff I like:
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Lord of the Rings</em> is my favorite book. <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> is my second favorite book. My favorite movie is <em>Blade Runner</em>. I like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchesse_de_Bourgogne_(beer)">good beer</a>, <a href="https://www.buffalotracedistillery.com/brands/sazerac-rye">American whiskey</a>, and <a href="http://www.bibledesignblog.com/">Bibles printed with good typography</a>. I have a completely unreasonable love for Apple products. I'm married to an amazing lady and I attend a <a href="http://www.ucgainesville.org/">really cool church</a>.
